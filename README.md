Overview
--------

**hrv** is a simple Python module that brings the most widely used
techniques to work with RRi series and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analyses without losing the **Power** and **Flexibility**
of a native Python object and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays.


For a more in-depth explanation of how hrv works, please [Read the documentation](https://hrv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
