Welcome to hrv's documentation!
===============================

**hrv** is a simple Python module that brings the most widely used
techniques to extract information about cardiac autonomic functions through RRi series and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analyses without losing the **Power** and **Flexibility**
of a native Python object.

In other words, the **hrv** module eases the manipulation, inspection, pre-processing, visualization, and analyses of HRV-related information. Additionally, it is written with idiomatic code and tries to implement the API of a built-in object, which might make it intuitive for Python users.
